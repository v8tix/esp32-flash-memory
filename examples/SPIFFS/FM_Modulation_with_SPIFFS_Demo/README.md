# FM Modulation with ESP32 and File System

This Arduino sketch showcases Frequency Modulation (FM) using the ESP32 microcontroller. The FM modulation is achieved by combining a carrier wave and a modulating wave. The resulting modulated wave is saved to the ESP32 File System (SPIFFS) for further analysis or use.

## Circuit Connection

- Connect the ESP32 DAC pins to the input of the analog system where you want to observe the modulated wave.

## Features

- Generates a carrier wave and a modulating wave.
- Performs Frequency Modulation (FM) by combining the carrier and modulating waves.
- Saves the modulated wave to the ESP32 File System (SPIFFS).
- Continuously play the modulated wave.

## Setup

1. Install the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the ESP32 development board to your computer.
3. Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the sketch to the ESP32.
